"""Sparse linear analysis: find which neurons / attention heads are "important" from saved activations.

This is an OPTIONAL analysis step. It turns the activations captured by main.py into a
spec file (analysis.json) that `python src/main.py --intervention analysis.json` then uses
to ablate the flagged neurons/heads and measure their causal effect.

Pipeline:
  1. Load saved inference results (.pt files from main.py) -> one row per prompt, each carrying
     the MLP-neuron and attention-head activations captured at the answer token.
  2. Group rows into CONDITIONS (assign_condition). A "condition" is any subset of rows you want
     to analyse separately so you can compare them -- e.g. A vs B vs C. (Default: one condition.)
  3. For each condition and layer, build a feature matrix X of shape [N_rows, num_mlp + num_heads]:
     the MLP neuron activations concatenated with one L2 norm per attention head.
  4. Fit an L1-regularised Lasso to predict a scalar target (build_target). L1 drives most
     coefficients to exactly zero, so the features with non-zero coefficients are the small set
     the model actually relies on -- the "important" neurons/heads for that condition.
  5. Save analysis.json: per layer, per condition, the important feature indices and their Lasso
     coefficients (weights), plus a top-level "conditions" block recording each condition's row count.

Two task-specific placeholders (search this file for TODO):
  - assign_condition(row, metadata): which condition a result belongs to (default: "all").
  - build_target(row, metadata):     the scalar the Lasso predicts (default: the answer token id).

Feature index convention (shared with main.py's intervention mode): indices 0..num_mlp-1 are MLP
neurons; indices num_mlp..num_mlp+num_heads-1 are attention heads.

Output format (analysis.json), consumed by `main.py --intervention`:
    {
      "num_mlp_neurons": int, "num_heads": int,
      "conditions": {                          # one entry per condition (from assign_condition)
        "<condition>": {"n_rows": int}         # how many rows backed this condition's fits
      },
      "layers": {
        "<layer_idx>": {                       # only layers/conditions with enough rows appear
          "<condition>": {"features": [int, ...], "weight": [float, ...]}
        }
      }
    }
Each "features" entry is a feature index (see the convention above); the matching "weight" is its
signed Lasso coefficient (effect size + direction of correlation with the target). At each layer,
main.py ablates the UNION of every condition's features. If you change this format, update the
reader in main.py's intervention block to match.
